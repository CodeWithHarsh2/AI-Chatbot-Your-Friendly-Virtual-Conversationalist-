# AI-Chatbot-Your-Friendly-Virtual-Conversationalist-

Ever wished you had a chatbot that could talk like a human and respond to your questions intelligently? Well, this AI Chatbot is exactly that! It’s a simple yet smart program written in C that can recognize keywords from your messages and respond in a way that feels natural. It’s like having a basic version of Siri or Alexa but built from scratch using C programming!
________________________________________
🛠 How Does It Work?
1️⃣ You type a message (e.g., "Hello!") \n
2️⃣ The chatbot analyzes your input by looking for keywords.
3️⃣ If it finds a match (like "hello" or "help"), it chooses a response from its database.
4️⃣ It randomly selects a response from a set of possible replies (so it doesn’t sound robotic!).
5️⃣ If it doesn’t understand, it politely tells you that it doesn’t know how to respond.

💡 What Makes It Special?

✅ Memory-Like Feature – Remembers context to provide better responses.
✅ Simple Yet Powerful – Written in C, but still feels interactive and fun!
✅ Expandable – You can add more responses and make it smarter!
